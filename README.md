# Axent

## Video Demonstration
The following video demonstration was created for the Congressional App Challenge. It shows most frontend features as they worked during production.

## What it is
Axent is a legacy project (no longer in development/working) designed to be a "tinder for fashion."
I (Judd Ebert, CTO) developed all code for this project over the course of 2025. It was sunsetted due to difficulties with expanding to a larger product base and pivots from the founders (me included) away from the idea.
Tech-stack wise, it used Flutter/Django. Outside technologies included Recombee for recommendations, KicksDB(at https://kicks.dev/), and Firebase for auth/security. You can figure out most of what I used from just looking at the code.
All accounts have been canceled, so the app won't function if you run as is. Feel free to use your own API keys if you'd like to give it a try!

## What I did/What I learned
I seriously did everything–from UI design to backend logic, API integration to animation coding.
I got my toes wet in about everything that comes with professional development and am comfortable contributing to projects at pretty much all stages now.

My main learning points were translating UI designs to frontend code, creating logic functions to synthesize data from/to 3 different databases, keeping track of user actions across both front and backend, and systems design from both the macro and micro level.

## Why it's here
I loved this project–it taught me a lot of what I know about programming–and I think it's cool to look back on.
Plus, I'd say some of the code was pretty well written.
Thanks for reading–hope you have fun poking through it!
